I'd like to start organizing and publishing my personal notes, with the goal of condensing these thoughts into something more concrete and shareable. The topics I'm most interested in writing about are, in no particular order:

* The Rust programming language
* Mechanical Engineering
* Computer Aided Design (CAD)
* Computer graphics
* Data visualization

This is a static site generated by [zola](https://www.getzola.org) from markdown files. Here's a code snippet using the *Fira Code* font family, with its nice ligatures:


```rust
fn main() {
    // Look at that fancy LEQ (<=) ligature!
    if 1 <= 2 {
        // Print text to the console
        println!("Hello {}!", fancy_function(&true));
    }
}

// Pass in a reference to a bool so the lifetime of the string is elided.
// Because there's a lifetime associated with the user-specified reference to a bool,
// the lifetime of the string output can be elided as having this same lifetime.
fn fancy_function(input: &bool) -> &str {
    match input {
        false => "Universe",
        true => "World",
    }
}
```

Now to test Katex support inline: {{ katex(body="\KaTeX") }}. Next let's try wrapping the line to make sure the text flows properly. Finally, let's try some Katex in block form:

{% katex(block=true) %}
\sum_{\mathclap{1\le i\le j\le n}} x_{ij}
{% end %}

I expect posts will be somewhat sporadic, and the content will probably only be interesting to a select few, or only myself. If you find yourself with common interests, I'm always happy to chat. Check the [about](/about/) page to get in contact!
