## About

This is a place for me to write about the topics that interest me. I don't expect anyone to read it. I hope it encourages me to make things, discover new fascinations, and gives me a place to look back at what I've accomplished.

I'm interested in the Rust ecosystem, computer graphics, and the intersection of Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science.

You can find my GitHub [here](https://github.com/aevyrie).
