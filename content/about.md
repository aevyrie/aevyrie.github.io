# Who are you? What are you doing inside my computer?

Hi, I'm Aevyrie. The name of this blog/writey-space is a double entendre for the inspirational *"someone working on cultivating their casual interests"* and the self deprecating *"programmer who doesn't know what they're doing"*. I'm shooting for the former, but usually end up closer to the latter. Good thing they aren't mutually exclusive.

*a person having a superficial interest in an art or a branch of knowledge : DABBLER*

This is a place for me to write about the topics that interest me. I don't expect anyone to read it. I'm hoping it encourages me to make things, discover new fascinations, practice my writing, and gives me a place to look back at what I've learned. I'm interested in the Rust ecosystem, computer graphics, and the intersection of Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science. Sometimes I enjoy illustration, photography, and graphic design. I use a computer and mouse to design consumer electronics and other things at my day job.
