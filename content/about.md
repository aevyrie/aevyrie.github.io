## About

This is a place for me to write about writing code. I don't expect anyone to read it. Instead, I hope it encourages me to continue developing software, learn new things, and gives me a place to look back at what I've accomplished.

I'm interested in the Rust ecosystem, computer graphics, and the intersection of Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science.
