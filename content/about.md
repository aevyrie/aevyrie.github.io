## About

The name of this blog/writey-space is a play on words. A double entendre for *"someone working on cultivating their casual interests"* and the self-derogatory *"programmer who doesn't know what they're doing"*.

This is a place for me to write about the topics that interest me. I don't expect anyone to read it. I hope it encourages me to make things, discover new fascinations, and gives me a place to look back at what I've learned.

I'm interested in the Rust ecosystem, computer graphics, and the intersection of Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science. I design consumer products at my day job.
