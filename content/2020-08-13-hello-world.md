All my previous attempts to write regularly have failed. I spend dozens of hours either hand crafting a static website from scratch, or I set up a CMS on a self-hosted server and spend hours customizing it until I've reduced my disdain for it to a manageable level. This always ends up the same way: the overhead of maintaining the site drains all the joy out of actually creating anything with it. Maybe this time will be different.

I'm not sure I even understand why I want to write things. I'm not particularly good at writing, and I definitely don't want the attention that putting your thoughts on the internet can bring. Maybe I want to feel that I've accomplished something - accumulated a body of work I can point to when the imposter syndrome kicks in. Whatever the reason, I'm here now writing this nonsense into VSCode on a Chromebook in Crostini, generating static web pages with [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola). Sometimes I wonder why I don't just use Wordpress like a normal person.

When it comes to side projects, I thought I had a laziness problem. Ideas are cheap and easy, and there are a million of them vying for my time and attention. Like writing, I would feel the need to scratch an itch, pour hours into said itching, then abandon it as soon as it stopped being fun. This was, and still is to some extent, a source of guilt and anxiety for me. It's difficult not to feel a sense of failure when all it appears you've accomplished is the sea of half-finished projects in your wake.

Is that really such a bad thing though? 

There seems to be a toxic culture surrounding free time and how it's spent. There's pressure to have a side hustle, and time spent outside  your salaried 40 should be spent making things; anything short of this is laziness. I don't know if this is a product of social media, larger cultural trends, or my imagination, but it feels very real to me. Looking back at those unfinished projects now, I don't think I had a laziness problem but a value problem.

I don't think there's anything wrong with unfinished projects, whether they failed due to unsurmountable hurdles or simple boredom. You need to know what matters to you, and honor that. What do you want out of your free time - your time spent tinkering? For me, I want to have fun, screw up without consequences, and learn. My time spent on those half-baked projects, barely-drafted design documents, and scrapped websites was a ton of fun, and I don't regret a moment of it.
