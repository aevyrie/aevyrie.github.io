All of my previous attempts to write regularly have failed. I spend dozens of hours either hand crafting a static website from scratch, or I set up a CMS on a self-hosted server and spend hours customizing it until I've reduced my disdain for said CMS to a manageable level. This always ends up the same way: the overhead of maintaining the site drains all the joy out of actually creating anything with it.

Maybe this time will be different.

I'm not sure I even understand why I want to write things. I'm not particularly good at writing, and I definitely don't want the attention that putting your thoughts on the internet can bring. Maybe I want to feel that I've accomplished something - accumulated a body of work I can point to in the future when the imposter syndrome kicks in. Whatever the reason, I'm here now writing this nonsense into VSCode on a Chromebook in Crostini, generating static web pages with [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola). Sometimes I wonder why I don't just use Wordpress like a sane person.

When it comes to these side projects, for the longest time I felt like I had a laziness problem. Side project ideas come easy, and there are a million of them vying for my time and attention. Like writing, I would feel the need to scratch an itch, pour hours into said itching, then abandon the project as soon as it stopped being fun. This was, and still is to some extent, a source of guilt and anxiety for me. It's difficult not to feel a sense of failure when it appears that all you've accomplished is a pile of half-finished projects, while someone half your age is building a working electron microscope in their bedroom.

Is that really such a bad thing though? 

There's a toxic culture surrounding leisure time and how it's spent. There's pressure to have a side hustle and half a dozen interesting hobbies; anything short of that is clearly laziness. I don't know if this pressure is a product of social media, larger cultural trends, or my imagination, but it feels very real to me and I don't think I'm alone. Regardless, it's unhealthy, and I think the solution is to reexamine our priorities when we feel that pressure.

There's nothing inherently wrong with unfinished projects, whether they failed due to unsurmountable hurdles or simple boredom. You need to decide what matters to you, and respect that (and yourself). What do you want out of your time spent working on these side projects? I want to have fun, screw up without consequences, and learn. My time spent on those half-baked projects, barely-drafted design documents, and scrapped websites was a ton of fun; why should I feel any regret?
