<p>Hi, I'm Aevyrie. Opinions expressed here are my own and not the views of my employer, affiliated organizations, or froody interplanetary beings.</p>
<p>The name of this blog/writey-space is a double entendre for the inspirational <em>&quot;someone working on cultivating their casual interests&quot;</em> and the self deprecating <em>&quot;programmer who doesn't know what they're doing&quot;</em>. I'm shooting for the former, but usually end up closer to the latter. Good thing they aren't mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>This is a place for me to write about the topics that interest me. I don't expect anyone to read it.
I'm hoping it encourages me to make things, discover new fascinations, practice my writing, and
gives me a place to look back at what I've learned. I'm interested in the Rust ecosystem, computer
graphics, and the intersection of Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science. Sometimes I enjoy
illustration, photography, and graphic design. I use a keyboard and mouse to design consumer
electronics and other things at my day job.</p>
